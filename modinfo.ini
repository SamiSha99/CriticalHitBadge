author="SamiSha"
description="Truly a fair and balanced mechanic![br][br]Any set of damage dealt will have a chance to deal 3x times that damage instead.[br][br]The more damage you deal in a short duration, the higher the crit chance is! Going from 10% up to 25%![br][br]Note: Check configs of this mod, there's a lot of cool stuff to mess with, like always critical hits, adjusting the lowest and highest chance, making the player affected by crits or enemy immune to it, etc.[br][br]This does not work on bosses because bosses are set to take 1 damage regardless of damage amount, making this badge completely useless in this case.[br][br]Made this in less than 24 hours, enjoy!"
